Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash. Change the current working directory to your local project. In the Command prom add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.com
How do I manually push to GitHub?
To push your local changes to the remote repository, in the repository bar, click Push origin. If there are commits on the remote branch that you don't have on your local branch, GitHub Desktop prompts you to fetch new commits from the remote. In the "New Commits on Remote" window, click Fetch.
